### [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)

To create a new project, you can use Cargo:

```
$ cargo new hello
```

To compile it, type:

```
$ cd hello
$ cargo build
```

And then run it:

```
$ ./target/debug/hello
```

We can also use cargo run to compile and then run it, all in one step:

```
$ cargo run
```
