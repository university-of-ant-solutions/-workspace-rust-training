# Rust - Training

From wikipedia

Rust is a systems programming language[11] with a focus on **safety**, **especially safe concurrency**,[12][13] supporting **functional** and **imperative-procedural paradigms**. Rust is syntactically similar to C++[according to whom?], but its designers intend it to provide **better memory safety** while still **maintaining performance**.
